# Data Readme

Collected are the ballot profiles of some RCV elections around the world. We tried to do a good job of parsing the data into a common format and handling over/undervotes the same way (in that each candidate is listed as the highest rank appearing on each ballot).

notes:
Some of the elections only allowed up to 3 ranks, others allowed a full ranking.
I have turned ranks into scores just by 1/rank because I think it's easier to process this way, but the original data is just a preference order, no scores were given.

## Scotland

All of the wards in Scotland have either 3 seats or 4 seats, but it changes depending on the city and the year.

## San Francisco

These elections are all for the SF Board of Supervisors. Each election was single-winner

## Minneapolis

The elections marked "may" were for the Mayor. These elections were single winner.
The elections marked "bet" were for the Board of Estimate and Taxation, and each elected 2 winners.
The elections marked "par" were for the Board of Parks and Recreations, each electing 3 winners.
